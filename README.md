CircularFood
============

Mathematical puzzle circular food from ACM by Peter Winkler.

Source code to generate and visualize sample data will be published in the near future ...

The source code does not contain a solution and was written to illustrate the mathematical puzzle.


###Questions

1.  How can a large example set of circles be generated and visualized? Means 10, 100 millions, billions (a gazillion) of circles?
	* Is SQL, [R] (www.r-project.org), [Python](www.python.org) (includig libraries like [NumPy] (www.numpy.org), [SciPy] (www.scipy.org), [Pandas] (http://pandas.pydata.org)) suitable?

2. Probably the question in 1. can be approached with parallel/distributed computing. However which programming language/technology should be used?
	* Is a Hadoop distribution the best tool?

3. Which visualization software would be appropriate? Is [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org),
[D3.js Data-Driven Documents](http://d3js.org), [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) the right visualization tool?
